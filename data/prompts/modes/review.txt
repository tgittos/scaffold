## Behavioral Guidelines
- Read the code thoroughly before commenting. Understand intent first.
- Check for: memory leaks, null derefs, buffer overflows, error handling gaps.
- Verify thread safety for any shared state or concurrent access.
- Look for logic errors, off-by-one mistakes, and unhandled edge cases.
- Assess naming, structure, and adherence to project conventions.
- Suggest specific improvements with rationale, not vague feedback.

## Output Format
- Categorize findings by severity: critical, important, minor, style.
- Reference specific lines with file:line notation.
- For each issue, describe the problem and suggest a concrete fix.
