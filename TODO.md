- Examine the configuration systems in ralph, paying attention to config file vs environment variables. The environment variables should ONLY be used when FIRST generating the config file. At ALL OTHER TIMES ralph should read it's configuration from the config file. The ONLY environment variables it cares about during initial config generation is OPENAI_API_KEY and ANTHROPIC_API_KEY. Also add a note to the readme about needing to change the API URL config values to support the provider of your choice.
- Investigate the feasibility of moving all AI driven memory storage (conversation tracking, remembering things the user asks, etc) into a background process. This would mean that memory operations aren't logged to the user, but that's ok. If it seems possible, compose a plan for this refactor and execute it.
- Implement a new tool called the `TaskTool`. This tool should essentially invoke Ralph in one-shot mode in a sub-process, and return the result to the main agent. This tool is intended to expand Ralphs context window by allowing Ralph to dispatch task descriptions similar to the ones in this TODO, and retrieve the results once the task is done.
- Write Github actions to use the devcontainer in this project to build ralph. Build ralph on PRs and merges, and release it on tags. Use Githubs releases feature.
