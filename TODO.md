- Refactor the conversation tracking system to just save every message sent to and received by the AI is stored in the vector db, not in a file. Ensure the agent queries the vector DB for recent history, in a sliding window. The agent should also be able to get more conversation history via tools if it needs. Implement missing vector DB functionality if you find you are unable to search by time frames in the vector DB.
- Implement a new tool called the `TaskTool`. This tool should essentially invoke Ralph in one-shot mode in a sub-process, and return the result to the main agent. This tool is intended to expand Ralphs context window by allowing Ralph to dispatch task descriptions similar to the ones in this TODO, and retrieve the results once the task is done.
- Write Github actions to use the devcontainer in this project to build ralph. Build ralph on PRs and merges, and release it on tags. Use Githubs releases feature.
