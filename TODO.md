- There is a bug with tool calling in this codebase. When a local model returns a tool use call, the application is displaying the raw tool use code to the user, as well as trying to execute the tool. Refactor the implementation so that the LLMs raw tool use invocation is not rendered to the user, whilst maintaining the informative output on actual tool use.
- The CLI interface for this application supports a subset of Readline-like features. Research how to compile Readline with Cosmopolitan, and refactor the user input functionality to use Readline.
- I want to upgrade the user feedback when a model calls a tool. I want to see a) the tool used, b) the arguments used, and c) the success/failure of the tool call. Some tool calls have long text strings as arguments,g so some kind of truncation is going to be required.
