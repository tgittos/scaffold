- The user needs the ability to maintain the vector DB to manage ralph's memories and remove bad chunks and fix metadata. Implement a user facing CLI tool submodule that can be accessed in the CLI through a slash command (eg: `/memory delete chunk-123`).
- Refactor the conversation tracking system to just save every message sent to and received by the AI is stored in the vector db, not in a file. Ensure the agent queries the vector DB for recent history, in a sliding window. The agent should also be able to get more conversation history via tools if it needs. Implement missing vector DB functionality if you find you are unable to search by time frames in the vector DB.
- Write Github actions to use the devcontainer in this project to build ralph. Build ralph on PRs and merges, and release it on tags. Use Githubs releases feature.
