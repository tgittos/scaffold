- Ideally the vector db presents a single facade of CRUD and search api functions without making a distinction between metadata and content (act as a document store with vector embedding search). Review the vector database implementation, specifically paying attention to the embeddings and metadata and text content storage. Determine if the current implementation is optimal for a RAG use-case, and refactor to that goal if not.
- Refactor the conversation tracking system to just save every message sent to and received by the AI is stored in the vector db, not in a file. Ensure the agent queries the vector DB for recent history, in a sliding window. The agent should also be able to get more conversation history via tools if it needs. Implement missing vector DB functionality if you find you are unable to search by time frames in the vector DB.
- Write Github actions to use the devcontainer in this project to build ralph. Build ralph on PRs and merges, and release it on tags. Use Githubs releases feature.
