- Create a tool for all LLM backends that allows the llm to search and perform CRUD operations on an arbitrary index
- Integrate the in-memory vector DB and tool to support RAG. I want the llm to manage the "memories" stored in it. The user should be able to instruct the LLM to remember something, and the LLM should automatically query the vector db for relevant context when appropriate. The LLM should also decide to store any textual fetched content from the internet and important memories and notes it determines based on user feedback, ie - remembering when the user corrects the LLMs behavior
- I think there's something wrong with the file tools. I tried to get the agent to write some code, and it was writing C but only wrote a partial C file that would never compile. It was using the Anthropic backend, so I wonder if there's a bug in the file writing tools causing the full content to not get written. The agent shouldn't make a simple mistake like that.
- The CLI interface for this application supports a subset of Readline-like features. Research how to compile Readline with Cosmopolitan, and refactor the user input functionality to use Readline.
